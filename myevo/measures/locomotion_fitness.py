    """Calculate fitness as forward displacement from a baseline time.

    This uses the x-axis displacement (forward direction in ARIEL) from
    a baseline time to avoid advantages from initial falling/settling.

    A height penalty is applied: if the robot's spawn height (morphology height)
    is above 0.21m, the spawn height is subtracted from the fitness. This prevents
    tall robots from exploiting falling/settling for free displacement.

    A contact penalty is applied to punish morphologies that exploit hinge-ground
    contact glitches. The penalty is 0.005 * contact_count. If contact_count exceeds
    200, the fitness is set to -1.0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tracker : Tracker
        Tracker with recorded position history.
    baseline_time : float
        Time in seconds to use as baseline (e.g., 1.0 for 1 second).
    model : mj.MjModel
        MuJoCo model (needed for timestep).
    spawn_height : float
        The spawn height (z-coordinate) of the robot's core at initialization.
        This is the robot's morphological height used for the penalty.
    contact_count : int, optional
        Number of unique rotor-ground contact events during the simulation, by default 0.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Forward displacement in meters from baseline time to end, with penalties applied.
